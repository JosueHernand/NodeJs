# ReadmeCraftNode

This project is a readme generator. This can quickly help someone make a readme file by using the terminal.
I made this project because I wanted to learn how to use NodeJs, so for practice I ended up wanting to start off by making a readme generator

## Installation

Then you can clone the repository and will need to install inquirer by running
